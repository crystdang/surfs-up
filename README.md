## by Crystina Dang using Python v3.9.12

### Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to convince the the investor, W.Avy, that the surf and shake shop in Oahu would be an ideal location by reviewing the weather patterns of the past, specifically June and December.

### Results: 

*The following image provides the summary statistics of all the of the June temperatures recorded in Oahu:*

*The three key differences of the two months are:*
1. The average temperature of June is 75, 4 degrees higher than December at 71.
2. Considering W.Avy's concern of low temperatures, the lower quartile is more important than the minimum. The lower quartile for June is 73, 4 degrees higher than December at 69.
3. The max temperature and the upper quartiles for both are only 2-3 degrees apart, in comparison to the difference of the lowest temperature being 8 degrees. This means the temperature range is larger for December, but it is still very warm.

### Summary: 

The produced data provides a very high level view of the temperatures of the two months that are in the middle of the two seasons in Hawaii, June in the summer and December in the winter. This may not be enough data for the investor to make an informed decision.

##Additional Possible Queries:

1. As the provided data may come back with more questions then answers, visualizing the used data can help support distilled information. A query that defines the years used on a scatter plot with different colours defining the two months can help the investor confirm there is a good range of data.

2. Considering that there are 183 more data points in June than December, a query to confirm no dates of each month is missing and skewing the data.

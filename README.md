### Results:

*The three key differences of the two months are:*
1. The average temperature of June is 75, 4 degrees higher than December at 71.
2. Considering W.Avy's concern of low temperatures, the lower quartile is more important than the minimum. The lower quartile for June is 73, 4 degrees higher than December at 69.
3. The max temperature and the upper quartiles for both are only 2-3 degrees apart, in comparison to the difference of the lowest temperature being 8 degrees. This means the temperature range is larger for December, but it is still very warm.

### Summary: 

There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. (5 pt)
